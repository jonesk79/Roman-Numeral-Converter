Roman-Numeral-Converter
=======================
Roman numerals are based on seven symbols:

Symbol  Value
I       1
V       5
X       10
L       50
C       100
D       500
M       1,000
The most basic rule is that you add the value of all the symbols: so II is 2, LXVI is 66, etc.

The exception is that you can't have more than three of the same character is a row: instead, you switch to subtraction. So instead of writing IIII for 4, you write IV (for 5 minus 1); and instead of writing LXXXX for 90, you write XC.

You also have to separate ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands. In other words, 99 is XCIX, not IC.

You can't count higher than 3,999 in Roman numerals.
